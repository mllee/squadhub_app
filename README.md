# SquadHub
It's a crappy name but give me a break, it was like 4am.
VandyHacks Fall 15 (iOS App)

College is a unique time where we're constantly surrounded by our friends, and it'd be
a shame to not spend that time enjoying each other's company as much as possible.

SquadHub was built off the idea that technology should connect people on a deeper level
than just retweets and likes.

The app lets you know which of your friends are nearby, and who's down to hang out at a glance.

You can set your own status as "Free," "Sorta," and "Busy," and your friends can
find out if you're nearby on campus and if you'd be down to do something; be that lunch, chillin', or
even just studying at the library together.

===========================================
...Yeah that's pretty much this hackathon app in a nutshell. I'm quite proud of it because
it's something I truly believe in: the idea that technology should connect us on a deeper level than
stupid reposts and mildly infuriating pokes.

It's fairly hacky because I solo hack'd it for iOS and I've never written a line of Objective-C before
the start of the weekend. 
As you might imagine, that leads to some technical... "shortcuts," but the MVP is there and  frankly 
I'm quite happy I was able to make something fully functional in a completely foreign language/stack in 24-ish hours.
